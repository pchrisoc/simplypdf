# PdfCraft roadmap

> SimplyPDF update 2026-11-05: app, CLI, crate and package names use SimplyPDF; takeoff work adds inline edits, category visibility, independent tool navigator/settings columns, and constrained HVAC presets. Native build, clippy, focused UI/automation tests, CLI rendering and asset/layer gates pass; upstream parity estimates unchanged.

**Stage: alpha** · next: beta, ~25% (ready for real work 50% → 75%) and ~400–700 h away

PdfCraft's one-page summary: how close it is to Adobe Acrobat Pro's offline feature set, and what
comes next. Adobe's cloud services (Document Cloud, Acrobat Sign requests, shared review, the AI
Assistant) are out of scope; PdfCraft's alternatives are local-first plus opt-in providers.

**Keep it current:** every session, update the milestone row in [docs/roadmap.md](docs/roadmap.md)
and add a line to the [progress log](#progress-log); when a gap closes, remove it from
[docs/gaps.md](docs/gaps.md); re-measure fully when a major arc lands, at least monthly.

## Headline numbers

| | Value | Kind |
|---|---|---|
| **Feature breadth** | **≈ 67%** tier-weighted (57.0% unweighted: 423 shipped + 75 partial of 808; P0 94.2%) | measured, `parity/acrobat-features.toml` |
| Feature breadth, mainstream practitioner | ≈ 70% tier-weighted (63.3% unweighted; P0 95.3%) | measured ([split](docs/target-app-parity.md#mainstream-practitioner-vs-full-acrobat-pro)) |
| **Ready for real work**, full Acrobat Pro | **≈ 50%** (45–53%) | estimated, weighted sum over [dimensions](#by-dimension) |
| **Ready for real work**, mainstream practitioner | **≈ 55%** (50–60%) | estimated ([split](docs/target-app-parity.md#mainstream-practitioner-vs-full-acrobat-pro)) |
| **Ready for real work**, essentials user | **≈ 66%** (60–70%) | estimated ([method](docs/target-app-parity.md#essentials-user)) |
| Remaining to **beta** | ≈ 400–700 Opus 5.5 agent-hours | estimated |
| Remaining to **full parity** | ≈ 780–1,400 Opus 5.5 agent-hours (≈ 300–550 h wall clock with 3–5 agents) | estimated, calibrated on this repo's history |

**Why alpha:** all six of Acrobat Pro's everyday workflows can be completed end to end on macOS
(the [alpha gate](docs/roadmap.md#alpha-gate)), and users praise them (7.6k stars, ≈ 217k downloads
of 0.4–0.5, switching reports such as #179). Two are only partial: editing (no CJK/RTL) and convert
and share (no in-app Office→PDF; Word export loses layout, #773; password-protected files open in
Acrobat since #836, #774). Those, unmeasured quality against Acrobat, the borrowed `hayro` renderer,
and 245 open issues keep it far from beta.

### Readiness by audience

| Audience | Ready | Opus 5.5 agent-hours to ≈ 95% | Work that dominates |
|---|---|---|---|
| Full Acrobat Pro (ready for real work) | ≈ 50% | ≈ 780–1,400 h (≈ 300–550 h wall clock with 3–5 agents; 60–70% parallelizes) | Own renderer and fidelity harness, editing existing content, OCR and Office conversion, Preflight and PDF/A/X/UA, accessibility tagging, signatures for institutions |
| Mainstream practitioner | ≈ 55% | ≈ 500–900 h (≈ 200–400 h wall clock; ≈ 60% parallelizes) | Rendering fidelity, editing existing text (CJK, RTL, subsets), conversion (Word layout, Excel, PowerPoint, Office→PDF), OCR languages, the bug backlog |
| Essentials user | ≈ 66% | ≈ 180–330 h (≈ 90–180 h wall clock; ≈ 50% parallelizes) | Rendering fidelity on everyday files, launch and GPU stability, simple text fixes, Word export layout, Chinese UI glyphs |

Hours are calibrated as in [Effort and calibration](docs/target-app-parity.md#effort-and-calibration) (≈ 1k kept lines per agent-hour for new features, 3–10× slower for hardening and fidelity). The audiences are nested subsets, so essentials ≤ mainstream ≤ full.

## Progress log

- 2026-11-06: Repository context cleanup: removed historical status preambles and append-only logs; retained milestone tables, scope, estimates and acceptance criteria. Historical details remain in Git (`git show 153b223d:ROADMAP.md`). Added `.ignore` for default search exclusions; no product behavior changed.
  Validation: `cargo fmt --check`, `target/debug/xtask layers`, `target/debug/xtask assets`,
  `git diff --check`, preservation of all pre-history table/section lines, and default `rg`
  exclusion checks passed. Removed ignored Cargo build output and Finder metadata;
  no Rust code changed, so compilation and runtime tests were not repeated.

- 2026-11-06 (PR-40 dependency repair): Fixed the reproduced font-import formatting
  failure and kept `rten = 0.26.0` aligned with `ocrs 0.13.1`, removing the incompatible
  0.27 runtime family from the lockfile. No feature or parity claims changed.
  Passing validation: `cargo fmt --check`; `cargo test --locked -p simplypdf-ocr
  -p simplypdf-fonts -p simplypdf-filters -j 2` (223 tests); scoped all-target Clippy
  with `-D warnings`; `cargo xtask layers`; `cargo xtask assets`; and scoped
  `cargo check --locked --target wasm32-unknown-unknown` for the same three crates.
  Native tests used Homebrew Rust 1.99.1; WASM used rustup Rust 1.98.1 with its
  installed WASM standard library. Full hosted platform reruns remain pending.

- 2026-11-06 (sandbox coding environment): PR #40 is merged as `87851d8c`; its
  GitHub CI, FreeBSD, Windows ARM64 and Nix checks passed. Installed the private,
  manual-only n8n Sandbox Coding Gateway and Doctor in the owner's personal project.
  Fixed non-login Rust PATH, provisioned missing build/oracle tools and the WASM
  target, freed 3.6 GiB of idle generated `/tmp` build output, and added isolated
  task checkouts, pinned build inputs, disk-backed temp/target directories, bounded
  serialized commands, SHA-checked edits, and explicit test results. Existing dirty
  checkouts and the separate experimental scheduler were preserved.
  Evidence: ten helper regressions pass locally and on the Debian VM; n8n input/output
  tests cover SSH failure reporting; real prepare/read calls pass. Gateway job
  `job-d6363c881dda` finished `done` with `ok=true` on source `87851d8c`, passing
  formatting, strict all-target Clippy, 116 filter/property/doc tests, layers (39
  crates), assets (252 repository / 6 bundled / 22 fetched), and scoped WASM checking.
  A source-change-during-verification regression was observed failing before its
  guard was added. Usage: [sandbox coding guide](docs/sandbox-coding.md). This improves the VM
  workflow; product feature completion and parity estimates are unchanged.
